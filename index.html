      <h2>My Expertise</h2>
      <p>I've got chops in all phases of the design process</p>

        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          I collaborate with clients and peers to nurture and transform ideas into well thought out design specs. After all, that's
          where the majority of amazing user experiences start.

        <i class="fa fa-magic fa-3x"></i>
        <h3>UX/UI</h3>
        <p>
          I sketch and wireframe interfaces focusing on content structure, intuitive UI patterns and simple interactions. I'm a minimalist
          who truly believes that less is more.
        </p>

      <div class="code">
        <i class="fa fa-code fa-3x"></i>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          I design in the browser with HTML(5), CSS(3) and a touch of JavaScript. I love coding things from scratch, but I can work
          with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap too.
